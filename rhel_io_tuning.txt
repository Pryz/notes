I/O Elevators
-------------

* CFQ (Completely Fair Queuing)
** Per process queue
** Each process queue gets fixed time slice (process priority)
** Default algorithm for RHEL

* Deadline
** Two queues per device, one for read and one for writes
** I/Os dispatched based on time spent in queue
** Recommended for single instance databases with dedicated storage

* Noop
** FIFO
** Simple I/O Merging
** Lowest CPU Cost
** Recommended for CPU-limited env
